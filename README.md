# Concentration Tracker using Face Mesh

This application uses computer vision to track a user's concentration level by monitoring eye openness and head orientation in real-time.

## Features

- **Eye Openness Detection**: Uses Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) to detect if eyes are closed (drowsiness)
- **Head Orientation Tracking**: Determines if the user is looking left, right, or center
- **Concentration Status**: Provides real-time feedback on focus level:
  - âœ… Focused (eyes open and looking forward)
  - ðŸ˜´ Drowsy (eyes closed)
  - ï¿½ Distracted (head turned left or right)

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- OpenCV (`pip install opencv-python`)
- MediaPipe (`pip install mediapipe`)
- NumPy (`pip install numpy`)

## How It Works

1. Captures video from your webcam
2. Uses MediaPipe's Face Mesh to detect facial landmarks
3. Calculates:
   - Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) for both eyes
   - Head orientation based on nose and cheek positions
4. Determines concentration status based on thresholds

## Customization

- Adjust `EYE_CLOSED_THRESHOLD` (default: 0.25) for sensitivity to eye closure
- Modify landmark indices in `LEFT_EYE_LANDMARKS` and `RIGHT_EYE_LANDMARKS` if needed

## Usage

1. Run the script: `python concentration_tracker.py`
2. Face the camera directly for best results
3. The system will display your concentration status in real-time
4. Press ESC to exit

## Potential Applications

- Study/work focus monitoring
- Driver drowsiness detection
- Attention tracking during online meetings

Note: For production use, consider adding temporal smoothing and more sophisticated head pose estimation.
